# AEDAT-File-Reader
</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is software to get details on a AEDAT file produced by a neuromorphic camera.
Currently this software can organize the starting time, ending time, duration, number of events, and average events per second in a table. This table can be converted to a .CSV file. This software can select multiple files at once leading to faster productivity.</p>
